A small, "Space Invaders" like game, developed with Pygame. The core of the project can be found in "Python Crash Course" (Eric Matthes, 2015). I simply developed it further (adding music, sound effects, sprites and animations) for fun. All images were taken from online sources, and I do not own any of them.
